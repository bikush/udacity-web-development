# Udacity Web Development

Solutions to Udacity ["Web Development: How to build a blog" course (cs253)][2].

Solutions are active on [my appspot][1] pages.

Implemented using Python (webapp2 module) on Google App Engine.

### Course overview/review

This course will show you the basics and beyond of developing your own web app using Google App Engine as a (suggested) service, since it has a lot of good (free) services easily available.

If you are interested in starting off with web development or just want to get an overview how web works, I could not recommend this course enough. The requirement it has is knowledge of Python (intermediate level would suffice), basics of OOP and basic understanding of basic data structures (lists, dictionaries). Algorithms mentioned in the course (e.g. hashing) are explained so that one can see how it is used and to an extent why. And most importantly, Steve Huffman is a really good instructor and all the videos are nicely done.

### Tasks

Here is a short description of assignments in the course.

#### Assignment 1

Create a "Hello, Udacity!" page using google app engine.

#### Assignment 2

Create a page that does Rot13 on an input.
Create a signup page that validates input.

#### Assignment 3

Create a simple blog that connects to the datastore in the background, displays a main page, a single entry page and enables input of a new entry.

#### Assignment 4

Implementing user registration, login and logout. The idea is to get familiar with tokens, token protection and password hashing/salting for security.

#### Assignment 5

Creating an API that enables retrieving blog entries and the main page as JSON data.

#### Assignment 6

Implementing memcache in the blog.

#### Final + bonus

Implement a wiki. Unregistered users can view any page on the wiki path. Users can register through the signup form. Logged in users can edit wiki pages, navigation to an unexisting page automaticaly prompts its editing. Every page has a history where all previous edits are visible. All versions of a certain page can be viewed and edited which will naturaly produce a new version.
